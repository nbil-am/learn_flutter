## Project Overview

This repository contains a small Flutter practice app used for experimentation and hands‑on learning. It’s designed to help you explore Flutter features, try patterns, and test small ideas without constraints of production requirements.

### Goals
- Learn and reinforce Flutter fundamentals.
- Explore UI patterns, state management, and navigation.
- Prototype widgets, animations, and platform integrations.

### Features
- Minimal, focused examples for quick iteration.
- Simple architecture suitable for modification.
- Companion tests demonstrating basic behaviors.

### Repository layout
- `lib/` — application Dart code and widgets
- `test/` — unit and widget tests
- `assets/` — images and other bundled resources
- `README.md` — project documentation and usage notes

### Getting started
Prerequisites: Flutter SDK installed and configured.

1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone <repo-url>
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
